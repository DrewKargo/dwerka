# Dwerka Project

This project was created on the basis of a test task from the Dwerka company. I did the layout of the site, after which there was a desire to add functionality using View.
At the moment, here you can sort the product, select the desired one and send it to the basket or select it from previously viewed ones. The shopping cart will automatically recalculate the amount of the purchase and the quantity of goods. You can also change the quantity or remove the goods directly from the cart.
